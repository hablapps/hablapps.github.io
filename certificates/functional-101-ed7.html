          <h1 class="first">Overview</h1>
          <p> The main goal of this course is introducing the basic functional programming techniques that fuel the most advanced libraries and applications nowadays (<a href="https://spark.apache.org/">Spark</a>, <a href="https://github.com/twitter/algebird">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/Haxl">Facebook</a>, etc.). These techniques are, amongst others, algebraic data types, higher-order functions, type classes, monads and pure functions. Throughout the course, you will learn what these techniques are, and, specially, why we should care about them, i.e. how they will help us to achieve higher levels of reusability, testability, evolvability, etc., in our code. To illustrate these functional techniques, we will pay special attention to the Spark library. Last, note that this is mostly a functional programming course that happens to be taught using Scala. So, the major lessons to be learned here will be readily applicable to your everyday programming tasks, even if you can't use Scala at your workplace (sigh).
          </p>

          <h1>Audience</h1>

          This course is specially made for you if you meet at least one of the following requirements:
            <li>You are fluent in Java, Scala, C#, Python, Javascript, Ruby, or any other non-functional programming language, and want to push the boundaries of your comfort zone. You have heard about the virtues of functional programming, and want to know what's all the fuss behind it, and why it really matters.
            <li> You are already familiar with functional programming concepts (inmutability, map, filter, etc.), but have not heard about monads, or you heard about them but you don't still use them to effectively manage your side effects.
            <li> You are determined to use Spark, and would like to get a comprehensive introduction to the functional programming principles behind this wonderful framework (higher-order functions and beyond).
            <li> You enjoy writing correct, robust and elegant code, and want to include in your CV some of the most acclaimed technologies and programming paradigms in the software industry nowadays.
          </p>

          The course requires a minimum level of familiarity with Scala. But don't worry if you know nothing about Scala! With the inscription in this course, you will get a discount for our <a onclick="showPage('scala-101');return false;">fast-track Scala course</a>. Last, note that no in-depth knowledge of Scala is needed, since more advanced concepts such as type constructors, higher-kind generics, implicits, etc., will be covered by this course.

          <h1>Objectives</h1>

          This course will enable you to:
          <ul>
            <li> Understand the essence of functional programming, and why you should embrace it
            <li> Exploit the functional programming features of Scala for great good!
            <li> Not being scare when someone says things like "monadic computation", and use monads to dramatically improve the testability and modularity of your designs
            <li> Understand the functional architecture of the Spark framework, and write complex data transformation programs in a purely functional style
          </ul>

          <h1>Outline</h1>
          <p>
            The course is divided into four major blocks. The first one introduces what is functional programming and why it really matters. We will learn that the power of functional programming comes from the many modularity techniques that it supports: generic programming, higher-order functions, type classes, pure functions, etc. The rest of the course is structured according to these different techniques: higher-order functions will be covered in the first section, type classes in the second one, and pure functions in the third one. The last fourth module of the course is entirely devoted to Spark. We will see how Spark exemplifies the functional abstractions introduced throughout the course (higher-order functions, pure functions, etc.) and will illustrate how we can write complex data transformation programs in a purely functional style.
          </p>

          <h1>Organization</h1>

          <ul>
            <li> The course runs over four consecutive Fridays, each session running for four hours. Setup instructions will be made available well in advance, so that attendees can bring their laptops properly configured to the classroom.

            <li> Explanations during sessions will alternate between slides and live coding, with a preference for the later. Small exercises and challenges will be proposed after each major block of contents, and solved in the classroom.

            <li> The course will be taught in Spanish.

            <li> After each session, attendees will be encouraged to complete a number of additional exercises on Github. Habla Computing trainers will provide feedback via code reviews for those who completed this coursework in due time. A chat room will also be made available to offer guidance and foster collaboration among course attendees.
          </ul>

          <h1>About the coordinator</h1>

          <p>The course is coordinated by Juan Manuel Serrano, and taught by him and Habla Computing specialists. Juan Manuel is CTO and co-founder of Habla Computing. He has been using Scala for the last five years in real-world applications for the banking sector, and has extensive experience in consultancy projects with Scala, Play, and other frameworks of the Scala ecosystem. He founded and manages the Madrid Scala Meetup group and is member of the organizing committee of <a href="https://lambda.world"  target="_blank">lambda.world</a>, the premier Spanish conference of functional programming for the software practitioner. Prior to joining Habla Computing, Juan Manuel was a University teacher for more than fifteen years in different computer science and software engineering degrees.</p>
